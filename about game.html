        <p class="about-text">
            In a world where the gods have fallen silent, Elyndria stands on the edge of collapse.
            Whispers tell of an ember — a relic left behind by the last guardian deity — capable of reigniting the world’s fading light.
            That ember now rests in the hands of Lucen Ardyn, a wanderer haunted by visions of forests turning to ash and stars dimming in the sky.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            Journey across shimmering groves, forgotten kingdoms, and shadow-soaked wastelands.
            Unravel the histories of beings long erased and confront forces that feed on Elyndria’s weakening spirit.
            Every step uncovers forgotten truths, and every choice pushes the realm closer to salvation… or oblivion.
        </p>
            Here, beneath the leaves, the final embers of hope wait for someone brave enough to ignite them.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            Explore enchanted forests, ruined citadels, and hidden temples as you uncover
            the truth behind Elyndria’s fractured past and shape the destiny of its fading light.
