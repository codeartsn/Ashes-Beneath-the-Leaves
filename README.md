🌑 Ashes Beneath the Leaves
A dark-fantasy exploration RPG set in the fading world of Elyndria.
Ashes Beneath the Leaves is a narrative-driven fantasy adventure where you play as Lucen Ardyn, the last emberbearer in a land slowly losing its light. Elyndria is a world shaped by memory, myth, and the silence of ancient spirits. Your journey is one of discovery, choice, and unraveling the quiet forces pulling the realm toward its end—without revealing the deeper mysteries waiting beneath its surface.
The game focuses on atmosphere, world-building, emotional storytelling, and a sense of wandering through places that remember more than they reveal.
